Introduction
============

This source code provides a simple implementation of intra-channel and inter-channel based descriptors in face PAD.
It includes the CCoLBP and the block based LBP.
It is very easy to use and reproduce our work.


Usage
=====

The two core functions of this implementation

a) For the CCoLBP

Example:

F = CCoLBP(I, s, r, config, mode);	% such as F = ColorCoALBP(I, 1, 2, 1, 'h');
	
This example returns the CCoLBP of the input image. Other parameters are described in CCoLBP.m.

b) For the block based LBP

Example:

lbp_blk = lbp_blk(I, lbp_r, lbp_p, mappingtype, mode, rowstep, colstep);	
% such as blklbpfea = lbp_blk(I, 1, 8, 'u2', 'h', 32, 32);

This example returns the block based LBP of the input image. Other parameters are described in lbp_blk.m.
